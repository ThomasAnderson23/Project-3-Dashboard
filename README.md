# Project-3-Dashboard

Welcome to our project! This app is the result of our efforts in the Fullstack Development Bootcamp program at UDD. We, Ellieth and Rodrigo, teamed up to create a dashboard that displays a chart by consuming an open API. We built this app using Node.js and relied on global libraries such as Chart.js, Axios, and nodemon as a development dependency. The app features a sleek user interface, designed with the idea of a nutritional app in mind. You can view the weight information for different users. This marks our first collaborative repository as a team, and we successfully merged the final code on Saturday at noon. We hope you enjoy this app as much as we enjoyed building it!
